# Quiz-App

This project was inspired by the learning apps available. Was created with ReactJS, NodeJS and MySQL.

## Functionality
Once registered, the user can create either four choices cards or flip cards and then go to the game page. There, they can select a game mode, either to generate a test with the multiple-choices question or study with the help of their flip cards.![Quiz1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114444914/211324851-092ff9d7-febb-41ca-95a8-c64bced7af01.png)
